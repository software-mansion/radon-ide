# Metro uses a utility library "launch-editor" to open files in the editor.
# "launch-editor" changes the way it passes line and column numbers to the editor
# based on the name of the command it launches. This script is a workaround to
# make it pass the correct arguments to `echo`, which we later use to open the
# file in the editor the extension is running in.
