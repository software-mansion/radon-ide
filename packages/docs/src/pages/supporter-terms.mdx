3.1 The Early Access Version Product is provided to Customer on a ‘per user’ basis, with a discount, where Customer may deploy the Early Access Version Product on multiple Machines in accordance with the Early Access Version Product documentation, provided that Customer remains the sole user of the Early Access Version Product.

3.2 The Early Access Version Product license will expire on October 31, 2024 after which it will automatically renew for an additional subscription period of twelve months, if the Product will be officially launched in its full version. The fees for the new subscription period will be discounted - the Customer will receive a -50% discount for a number of months of subscription equal to the number of months of the Early Access Version Product that the Client paid for. Customer authorizes Software Mansion to charge Customer’s payment card automatically on November 1 for additional, monthly subscription period, and in the full amount of $ 19.00 and further discounted as above. For more information on how the payments are processed, please see the React Native IDE Purchase Terms available at: [ide.swmansion.com/purchase-terms](https://ide.swmansion.com/purchase-terms).

3.3.

(B) You may not:

(i) allow the same Subscription to be used concurrently by another user apart from yourself;

3.4. This subscription is only for natural persons who are purchasing a subscription to Products using only their own funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, you may not use any of the Products, and this grant of rights shall not be in effect, in the event that you do not pay Subscription fees using your own funds. If any third party pays the Subscription fees or if you expect or receive reimbursement for those fees from any third party, this grant of rights shall be invalid and void.

3.5. Customer acknowledges that no ownership rights are conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as ‘purchase’ or ‘sale’. Software Mansion has and retains all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products, any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of the Products, including without limitation as they may incorporate Feedback (as defined below).
