## Refunds

<br />

Software Mansion, in its sole discretion, may give refunds for some Radon IDE purchases, depending on the refund policies described below.

In general, no refunds are available for monthly or annual subscriptions.

However, refunds can be requested for subsequent annual renewals under the following conditions:
The refund request must be made within 14 days of the renewal date.
Users must contact our support team to request a refund.

Moreover, for all subscription purchases, the refunds may be requested under the following circumstances:
If a purchase was accidentally made by a friend or family member using your account,
If you find a purchase on your card or other payment method that you didn't make and that wasn't made by anyone you know, report unauthorized charges within 120 days of the transaction.
Multiple requests for the same transaction don't expedite the refund process. Refund decisions may take 1â€“4 business days.

## Cancellation

<br />

Customers can cancel their subscriptions at any time through their account settings. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and users will continue to have access to their subscription benefits until that time. No pro-rated refunds are issued for cancellations made during an active subscription period.

## How to Request a Refund

To request a refund for an eligible annual subscription renewal, please contact our support team via email: ide@swmansion.com.
Please provide your account details and the reason for the refund request. Our support team will review your request and get back to you within 5 business days.
