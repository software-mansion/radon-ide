    topic: "Can I use Radon on Windows and Linux?",
    answer: `Due to limited capacity, support for Linux and Windows is considered beta. Because of that, we don't distribute Windows or Linux builds via VSCode marketplace and you have to follow <a href="/docs/getting-started/installation" target="_blank">manual installation instructions</a>. Since Windows and Linux support is in beta, you don't have to purchase a license to use Radon on those platforms, and you can use it under the free Beta license but keep in mind that the number of features will be limited.`,
