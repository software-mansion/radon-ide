On this page we discuss how to activate, purchase and manage your Radon IDE license. 

## Getting your license key

### Logging in to the Radon IDE customer portal

All your needs related to licenses are addressed in the [Radon IDE customer portal](https://portal.ide.swmansion.com/). You can log in by providing an email
you used to purchase the license. We'll send a magic link to the provided address that will allow you to log in.

### Retrieving your license key 

Once you are logged in to the customer portal, you can get your license key on the **Manage subscription** page by clicking on the tree-dot menu and either coping the key to the clipboard, 
or revealing it and coping it yourself.

## Registering your device

To activate your device click **Activate License** button in Radon IDE. It will open a modal with an input field for your license key. After registering, your device will appear in the manage subscription page.

## Managing your subscription

### Registered devices

 In the **Manage subscription** page of the [customer portal](https://portal.ide.swmansion.com/) you can manage registered devices through the tree-dot dropdown menus next to them. You can change their names to easier distinguish the user or remove them if you want to switch devices you use Radon IDE on.

### Number of seats

In the **Manage subscription** page you can click on **Manage seats** to increase or decrease their number. The only restriction is that if you want to decrease the number of seats below the number of currently registered devices, you need to remove them first.
