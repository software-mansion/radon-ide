## Click to inspect

Using the built-in inspector you can jump directly from preview to a file where your component is defined.

## Use breakpoints right in VSCode

Without any additional setup, the extension allows you to add breakpoints in Visual Studio Code to debug your React Native application.
IDE also automatically stops at runtime exceptions showing you the exact line of code where they happened.

Learn more about the [Debugging and logging](/docs/features/debugging-and-logging).

## Logs integration

Radon IDE uses the built-in VSCode console allowing you to filter through the logs.
The links displayed in the console are automatically linking back to your source code.

## Router integration

The Radon IDE integrates with your deep-linked application allowing you to jump around the navigation structure.

## Develop components in isolation

Develop your components individually without distractions.

Install `radon-ide` package and use `preview` function from it to define the components that should render in preview mode:

```js
import { preview } from "radon-ide";

preview(<MyComponent param={42} />);
```

The extension will display a clickable "Open preview" button over the line with `preview` call that you can use to launch into the preview mode.

Learn more about [Previews](/docs/features/previews).

## Adjust device settings on the fly

You can adjust text size and light/dark mode right from the Radon IDE.
Focus just on your app without switching between windows.

Learn more about the [Device settings](/docs/features/device-settings).

## Instant replays

Missed a bug? At any time you can re-watch what just happened on the device. No need to manually start the recording ever again.
