- [**Run Maestro tests directly in Radon**](/docs/features/maestro-integration.md): Start your maestro test directly from the flow file, and run them on the device selected in Radon -- while accessing all of the Radon's inspection tools.
- Radon now respects `.nvmrc` files when `nvm` is installed.
- Improved stability on projects using `react-compiler`.
- More stability improvements and bug fixes.
