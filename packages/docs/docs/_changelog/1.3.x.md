- [**Built-in Network Inspector**](/docs/features/dev-tools#network-inspector): Network panel captures and lists all requests triggered by the JavaScript code (with HXR / fetch or wrappers like Axios/Apollo etc). Images or websocket connections aren't currently supported and won't show up.

</video>

- [**First-party Redux DevTools integration**](/docs/features/dev-tools#redux): If your app uses Redux, the IDE will automatically detect that, and Redux plugin will be listed in the Dev Tools menu where you can enable it. Once enabled you will be able to use the official Redux UI from within your editor panel.

- The panel now matches editor theme by default

- Support for React Native 0.78
