title: "Backgound devices, MCP integration for Radon AI, and React Native 0.80 support"
---

- **Run devices in background**: Now, when switching between devices, Radon IDE will no longer terminate the previous device. This allows you to quickly switch between Android and iOS. You can turn off this behavior in _Manage Devices_ window, or you can terminate active devices directly from the devices dropdown.

- **MCP integration for VSCode and Cursor**: You can now use [Radon AI](/docs/features/radon-ai) in both VScode and Cursor's "Agent mode". In 1.8 Radon AI ships with additional tools for querying our react native docs database but can also capture device screenshots to help the agent debug or make UI adjustments (note that the image features currently work only with Gemini and Claude models)

- **React Native 0.80 support**: This version supports the most recent release of React Native.

- Lots of bug fixes
