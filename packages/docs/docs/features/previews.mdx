Previews allow you to develop components in complete isolation from the rest of your application.

To use previews first, add `radon-ide` package to your project.

<Tabs groupId="package-managers">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm i radon-ide

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="YARN">

    yarn add radon-ide

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `radon-ide` package comes with a `preview` function.

```js
import { preview } from "radon-ide";
```

You call the `preview` function with a JSX component as the first argument. The function needs to be called in a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file outside of the component body.

```jsx
preview(<MyComponent param={42} />);
```

The extension will display a clickable `Open preview` button over the line with `preview` call.

<img width="500" src="/img/docs/ide_previews.png" className="shadow-image" />

Clicking the `Open preview` button will launch the chosen component in isolation.

<video autoPlay loop width="700" controls className="shadow-image">
  <source src="/video/6_sztudio_preview.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

You can quickly test different variants of the same component by rendering different previews based on props.

<video autoPlay loop width="700" controls className="shadow-image">
  <source src="/video/ide_different_previews.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

You exit the preview by using the `Go to main screen` button in the top-left corner of the panel or by reloading the application.
