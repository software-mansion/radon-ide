## Limitations

1. Radon AI will refuse answering questions outside of the React Native and Expo domain.

2. Like any technology based on large language models, Radon AI is prone to errors. Make sure to check important information before making decisions.

3. Currently (April 2025) the knowledge database used by Radon AI does not contain code. This means that React Native code snippets generated by Radon AI might not be accurate.

## Privacy

We do not store user queries (prompts), code or any data provided to the Radon AI chat. Your data is used to query the Radon AI knowledge database before sending it to GitHub Copilot Chat large language model alongside with package versions used in your project.
