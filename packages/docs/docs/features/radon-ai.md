Radon AI is a set of tools enhancing your editor's Agent, with among other things - up-to-date knowledge about the React Native ecosystem, comprehensive set of debugging data, that isn't otherwise available, and app interaction abilities. You can find the full set of tools available to it: [here](/docs/features/radon-ai#available-tools).

We index all of the popular React Native libraries to match questions to relevant pieces of documentation, providing additional, accurate context to your conversation.

Our knowledge database is updated daily to provide the most up-to-date information.

## Pre-requisites

- Cursor Editor or Visual Studio Code 1.99 or newer
- In Visual Studio Code: Access to [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat). GitHub Copilot Chat comes with a [GitHub Copilot Free](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-free/about-github-copilot-free) without needing to sign up for another subscription.
- An active [Radon IDE license](/docs/guides/activation-manual)

## Usage in Visual Studio Code

Radon AI assistant integrates with VSCode's `agent mode`.

To access `agent mode` in Visual Studio code use `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `Cmd + Shift + I`.

Alternatively, open VSCode command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P`) and type `Chat: Open Chat`, then select `agent mode`.

Alternatively, you can type and run `View: Open MCP Settings` from the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P`).

## Available tools

The AI models automatically discover and invoke tools when they decide it will be useful. You can query the agent to use the tool by mentioning it's name in the prompt. These are currently available tools in Radon AI:

- `get_library_description` Provides a detailed description of a library and its use cases.
- `query_documentation` Retrieves documentation snippets relevant to a provided query.
- `reload_application` Triggers reload of the application. The AI may choose whether to restart the application process, reload just the JS bundle, or rebuild the entire app.
- `view_application_logs` Returns all the build, bundling and runtime logs available to Radon IDE. If the app builds and launches successfully, this tool will also attach a screenshot of the app.
- `view_screenshot` Captures a device preview screenshot. Can help the agent with debugging issues and making UI adjustments. Currently only supported in GPT, Gemini and Claude models.
- `view_component_tree` Displays the component tree of the running app. This tool allows the agent to gain a broad understanding of the project's structure.

## Limitations

1. Radon AI will refuse answering questions outside of the React Native and Expo domain.

2. Like any technology based on large language models, Radon AI is prone to errors. Make sure to check important information before making decisions.

3. Currently (June 2025), the knowledge base used by Radon AI contains only documentation files. While some documentation pages contain code snippets, we do not index the full source code of the libraries. For this reason, the React Native code generated by Radon AI may not be accurate.

4. GitHub Copilot Free is limited to 50 chat messages per month. When you reach this limit, you can upgrade to Copilot Pro to continue using Radon AI.

## Disabling Radon AI

To disable Radon AI assistant navigate to the editor settings.

You can type `Preferences: Open User Settings` in the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P`).

Within editor settings, type `Radon AI: Enabled`, press the first result and select `Disabled`.
