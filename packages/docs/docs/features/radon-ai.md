Radon AI is a [GitHub Copilot Chat participant](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-chat/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide#chat-participants) enhanced with up-to-date information about the React Native ecosystem.
At the heart of it is our extensive React Native knowledge database, which is queried before answering your question.

We index all of the popular React Native libraries to match questions to relevant pieces of documentation, providing additional, accurate context to your conversation.

Our knowledge database is updated daily to provide the most up-to-date information.

GitHub Copilot Chat comes with a [GitHub Copilot Free](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-free/about-github-copilot-free) without needing to sign up for another subscription.

Radon AI has the context of the history of previous messages sent in the chat window started with `@radon`. This allows you to send additional follow-up questions.

## Limitations

1. Radon AI will refuse answering questions outside of the React Native and Expo domain.

2. Like any technology based on large language models, Radon AI is prone to errors. Make sure to check important information before making decisions.

3. Currently (April 2025), the knowledge base used by Radon AI contains only documentation files. While some documentation pages contain code snippets, we do not index the full source code of the libraries. For this reason, the React Native code generated by Radon AI may not be accurate.

4. GitHub Copilot Free is limited to 50 chat messages per month. When you reach this limit, you can upgrade to Copilot Pro to continue using Radon AI.

## Privacy

To provide accurate responses, queries that you type to Radon AI chatbot along with the list of your project dependencies are sent to our servers in order to search our knowledge database. The data that is sent is not stored in any form on our servers but only used for the duration of the request in order to perform the query.
